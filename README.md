# odin-recipes

This is a simple recipe website built using HTML and CSS. I wanted to share three of my favorite dishes (one of which is tea), so let's say two of my favorite dishes, plus my favorite tea. I also learned how to embed a video, which Iâ€™m really proud of. I usually don't use video links, but for this project, I decided to give it a try. I learned about the <iframe> tag in HTML, which is new to me. To help me accomplish this, I referred to resources like Google and W3Schools.
