    <h2> Somali Shaahi Recipe: I am a tea lover</h2>

    <hr>

    <p>I absolutely love drinking Somali shaah (chai)! I believe everyone should have the chance to try it, even if you're not the biggest tea fan. The spices and aroma make it what it is—sweet, warm, and comforting. </p>

       <h3>Steps:Follow these directions to make the best Somali Chai </h3>
       <em> You do not have to boil the milk with the water, instead you can do two more cups of water and add milk later.</em>
       <ol>
        
        <li>
            Crush the ginger with the bottom of a heavy pot or the blunt edge of a knife and set aside.
        </li>
       <br>
        <li>
            Place the cinnamon, cardamom,and cloves in a mortar and crush with a pestle until coarsely ground (or crush on a countertop or on a cutting board with the bottom of a heavy pot). 
        </li>
        <br>

    
        <li>
            Transfer the spices to a medium saucepan set over medium heat and cook, stirring, until very fragrant, about 1 minute. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> 
            Add the ginger, water, tea, and sugar and increase the heat to high. Once bubbles form around the edge, immediately reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in the milk and let it cook for just 1 minute to warm the milk, then turn off the heat. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a teapot, pitcher, or straight into tea mugs. Serve immediately while hot and add more sugar to taste if you’d like.</li>
