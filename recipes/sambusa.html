       <ol>
        
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, leek, and garlic in hot oil until onion is transparent. Add ground beef; cook and stir until still slightly pink and about halfway done. Season with cumin, cardamom, salt, and pepper; mix well. Continue cooking until beef is browned and crumbly. Remove the skillet from heat.

        <li>Mix together flour and water in a small bowl to make a thin paste. Using one wrapper at a time, fold into the shape of a cone. Fill cone with beef mixture, close the top, and seal with paste. Repeat until wrappers or filling are used up.

        <li>
            Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 365 degrees F (170 degrees C). There should be enough oil to submerge sambusas. Fry sambusas, a few at a time, in hot oil until golden brown. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
