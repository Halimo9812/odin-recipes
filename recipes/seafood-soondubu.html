    <h2> Soondubu Jigae Recipe: My all time favorite Korean dish </h2>

    <hr>

    <p>Sundubu-jjigae (sometimes spelled soondubu-jjigae) is a spicy, seasoned stew made with a type of silky soft tofu called sundubu. Served hot at the table in its traditional earthenware bowl, it’s impossible to resist. </p>

       <h3>Steps: I got this from Maangchi from youtube</h3>
       <ol>
        
        <li>
            Combine the hot pepper flakes, sesame oil, and black pepper in a small bowl. Mix well with a spoon until the hot pepper flakes absorb all the oil. Set aside.
        </li>
       <br>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, garlic, the chopped white part of the green onion, and mushroom. Stir with a wooden spoon until the onion and garlic are slightly brown and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the stock. Cover and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until it’s boiling vigorously.

        </li>
        <br>

    
        <li>
            Add shrimp, oysters, and mussels. Cut the tubes of tofu in half and squeeze them into the boiling stew, and then break up the tofu a bit with a wooden spoon. If using silken tofu, scoop or squeeze from the box into the stew.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Add the fish sauce (or salt to your taste), half of the hot pepper mixture, and stir a few times.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Cover and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until the seafood is fully cooked and the broth is infused with its savory flavor.
        </li>
